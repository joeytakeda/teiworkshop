# TEI Workshop
This repository houses the material for the TEI workshops given on September 20 and October 25th at UBC. 

## Workshop 1: What is the TEI and Why Should I Care

This workshop is an introduction to Text Encoding Initiative: an open-source, community based, multilingual standard for digital textual scholarship that gives scholars a vocabulary and a method to create richly expressive and critically informed versions of their texts (whether that be a poem, a novel, a manuscript, an inscription on a tombstone, or even an audio recording). This workshop thus has two main goals: (1) introduce participants to textual encoding and the wide range of possibilities that are afforded by good, critical markup and (2) help participants understand why TEI might work for their own projects.

By the end of this one-hour workshop, participants should become familiar with the variety of projects that use TEI, understand the expressive power of the TEI, and walk away understanding how working in TEI could be benefit their upcoming translation, edition, transcription, et cetera. This workshop is open to anyone interested in “text,” however broadly defined. Absolutely no technical skills are required, but participants are asked to bring a text (either analog or digital) to work with during the workshop.
